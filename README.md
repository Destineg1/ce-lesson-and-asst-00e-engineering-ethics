**NOTE:** 
1. This lesson & assignment [README](README.md) is _intentionally_ blank, to be used as your notebook for study and discussion. _It is a great aid for your study and the main component of your submission._
2. Read and follow the [lesson-and-assignment](lesson-and-assignment.md).
3. For this assignment, readability, clarity, and proper formatting are required. Refer to the lesson-and-assignment document for examples, and the [Github markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). The cheat sheet doesn't exhaust all you can do with markdown in a Github README.md. If you need more sophisticated elements, search on Google and/or ask the course staff.

_Your study and submission work here..._

What is the most generic definition of ethics that you can find in the encyclopedia? 
	Activities or actions that sway an individuals behavior, And what I mean by that is ethics is questions if something for “good” example: (PETA question the ethics on animal testing) and if its beneficial and does more good then bad

What are three (3) domains of ethics that are the most novel and striking to you?
	African, Chinese, Feminist enviormental Philosophy 

Where does Aristotle lay the burden of responsibility for ethical behavior?
	One attains happiness by a virtuous life and the development of reason and the faculty of theoretical wisdom. For this one requires sufficient external goods to ensure health, leisure, and the opportunity for virtuous action. And he was saying that in order for someone or a group of something to be “good” they would need to be swayed by an outside force to be “good”

If all people were ethical in all their interactions, which centerpiece of modern society would be obviated?
	*Superiority, Because their would be nobody to determine if something is deemed “good” or “bad”  or any alternatives because since most people would be ethical and be on the”good” side there would be no need for people to be above people and be more seen as equals 

Give an example of an extreme case from recent history that favored the group to the detriment of the individual. How would you embed the principle of balance of the interests of the individual and the group into the ethical code itself? Be specific.

Discuss the article in 3.2.1
	The way that ethics plays a big role in this is when natural disasters strike scientist try to rush to the scene of where it happened no matter the location of where it is located and the way that this can conflict is the argument between the “good” and how the scientist think they are doing research without regards to the locals and the locals not liking the way that they come and many declining interviews or not wanting anything to do with the scientist that come in.

discuss the issues you picked in 3.2.2
	The issues I picked regarding the ethicals of covid-19 are Quarentine, Stimulus checks, Stock Shortages 
	Quarantine: Becausee the government made a mandatory stay at home order which a lot of locals sees as un-neccasary based on the many protest against it at the capitol and how some people see it as a good thing because its lowered the spread of the virus and some people seeing it as unethical because its not going to actually stop the spread but just cause people to want to disobey anyway 
	Stimulus checks: The stimulus checks were a rough topic to discuss because some people seen it as a good thing that they were getting money while a lot of people where against it because they felt like it wasn’t doing enough based on the ways that the rest of the world has handled the pandemic 
	Stock shortages: the reason I chose this issue was because when the pandemic was announced people flooded to the grocery stores to purchase stock such as food and medical supplies in large bulk not allowing people who need it to get what they need from stores which a lot of people send it as a good thing because they were able to stocked up on supplies needed in order to quarantine but a lot of people were against it because it wasn't leaving enough stock for older people and people more at risk to be able to receive the things they need

How does it mesh with your prior understanding of what computer engineering is about? Did you get a new perspective on an aspect that you hadn't considered up to now?
	I just seen computer engineering as a degree that only has to deal with math and wires and making and inventing new things and now after reading the article its shifted my view of seeing computer engineering as a way of helping people and to be able to meet social needs
