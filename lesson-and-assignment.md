This is lesson and assignment 00e for the Spring 2020 installment of the CPE 1040 - Intro to Computer Engineering course at MSU Denver.

## Learning how to learn

The human mind is a very fine machine with amazing capabilities. Like any complex mechanism, it takes study to learn to use it effectively. This standalone section contains 2 brief practical pointers on learning how to learn.

##### Learning How to Learn 02

1. Short-term memory capacity.   
   Learning relies fundamentally on memory. The human brain stores most of the information and knowledge we have learned, and has a mechanism for continuous perception and learning new things. Perhaps the most important part of this mechansim is the _short-term memory_ subsystem, which is responsible for briefly holding our most recent memories until long-term memory structures are created to hold them over the long run. The short-term memory system has very limited capacity, so it pays to know its basic operational principles to maximize its use in our learning. In particular,
   - short-term memory is the _bottleneck_ to forming new memories, and, thus, new knowledge;   
   - memories in short-term memory are very volatile, and, unless focused attention is directed to them, they disappear; and   
   - only 4 concepts at a time can be held stably in short-term memory, even with focus, and adding just one more causes one to fall out.   
   
   TO DO: Start to monitor what you are holding in your mind _at this very moment_. This is notoriously difficult until you gain some experience. The fundamental practice that humanity has come up with that can help in gaining experience is _meditation_. The main purpose of meditation is to help you gain _conscious control_ over what you are thinking about, and the _repeatable skill_ to resist distraction: "Oh, I am thinkning of this now. I don't want to think of that. I will just let it go."; "I have 5 things that are clamoring for my attention, but if I attend to all of them, I will get confused. So, I will attend to them one by one. I will choose this one to be the first."; "To understand this new concept, I have to base it in something that I already know. It stands to reason that I should pick _three_ of the closest concepts to the new concept, to hold them in my mind and _think_ how to best attach the new concept."; "I need to come back to things that I have recently learned, because otherwise they fade and I have to start from scratch. The best time for the first review is _tomorrow_, then _in three days_, then _in two weeks_."; "Another thing I should do with new knowledge is look at it from _different perspectives_, to make my associations denser and form a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of it, and thus make it that much more solid."

2. Procrastination as addiction.   
   _Procrastination_ is and effect of the simultaneous realization that one has to do something and the feeling of internal pain at the thought of doing it. It has been proven that procrastination is _habitual_ and functions like _an addiction_. Recent theories about addiction recognize the _internal conflict among severl different but related neural circuits_ in the brain. Unfortunately, these systems act below the level of our conscious experience, and we, despite of realizing that we are engaging in _self-sabotage_ and _self-defeating behavior_, feel powerless to change. The full neurological picture is complex and still incomplete, but there is a very helpful model (that is, a simplification) that anyone can employ to deal with addiction and, in particular, procrastination. Here's a quote from the online course [Learning How To Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/p7wRU/zombies-everywhere) (highlights added): _You can think of habits as having four parts, the first, is the **cue**. This is the trigger that launches you into zombie mode, the cue may be something as simple as seeing the first item in your to-do list. Time to start next week's homework or seeing a text message from a friend, time does stop work. A cue by itself is neither helpful or harmful. It's the routine, what we do in reaction to that cue. That's what matters. Number two, the **routine**. This is your zombie mode, the routine habitual response your brain is used to falling into when it receives the cue. Zombie responses can be useful, harmless or sometimes harmful. Number three, the **reward**. Every habit develops and continues because it rewards us. It gives us an immediate little feeling of pleasure. Procrastination is an easy habit to develop because the reward, moving your mind's focus to something more pleasant happens so quickly and easily. But good habits can also be rewarded. Finding ways to reward good study habits is important for escaping procrastination. Number four, the **belief**. Habits have power because of your belief in them. For example, you might feel you'll never be able to change your habits of putting off your studies until late in the day. To change a habit, you'll need to change your underlying belief. I'm Barbara Oakley, thanks for learning how to learn._
   
   TO DO: Once you are aware for the _structure_ of a habit, you can attack it in various ways. First, be conscious of the cue, and either try to avoid it or, if you can't, give yourself some space before launching into the routine. Second, if you find yourself already in the routine, take some time to break it. Just stop doing what you are doing, and attend to something else. (But, be careful that you are not just modifying the routine, rather than breaking it.) Third, be aware of the reward. At first you should just savor it, but with time, you should find a different way of getting it, so you break the dependence on the habit. Lastly, voice aloud your belief, and then try to argue against it. The [two-minute principle and the growth-mindset sections](https://github.com/ivogeorg/ce-lesson-and-asst-007-logic-gates/blob/master/lesson-and-assignment.md#learning-how-to-learn-03) might help!

## Lesson & Assignment 00e: Applied engineering ethics

### Section 1: General ethics

#### 1. Study

The domain of ethics is vast, but its most important dimension of variation is whether it is more theoretical or more applied. The theoretical aspects of ethics are inextricable from the domain of [philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/). Ethics is one of the fundamental questions in philosophy, so we will only take a quick look, and not dive into it. The [applied](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/) side is more interesting to us because it gives us concrete things to do to make things better. Interestingly enough, the Aristotle's [Nichomachean Ethics](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8438), considered the foundational work in Western Ethics, is expressly applied!

#### 2. Apply

1. Make a search on "ethics" at the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/). You will see page upon page of results on various kinds of ethics. _What is the most generic definition of **ethics** that you can find in the encyclopedia? What are three (3) domains of ethics that are the most novel and striking to you?_
2. Read the [Introduction](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/e/ethics/about-aristotles-ethics) to Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. _Where does Aristotle lay the burden of responsibility for ethical behavior?_

#### 3. Present

In the [Study & Discussion](README.md):

1. Write a paragraph each answering the two questions in 1.2.1.
2. Write a paragraph answering the question in 1.2.2.

### Section 2: Applied ethics

#### 1. Study

The two most important points I would like to you learn and understand about ethics are:

1. Ethics is not about your beliefs, habits, and predilections, but about a **group's consensus on what is the right behavior** of its members that will ensure optimal operation and longevity, whatever the domain or subject matter of interest of the group. 	

2. Ethics can be about everything and anything, but it **requires whole-system analysis** in every case.

#### 2. Apply

1. Read the following sections and/or articles at the [Center for Applied Ethics](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/ethical-decision-making/): 	
   - Introductory Articles
   - Approaches to Ethical Decision Making
   - A Framework for Ethical Decision Making
   - Ethics in Organizations 	
2. Answer the question: _If all people were ethical in all their interactions, which centerpiece of modern society would be obviated?_
3. Ethics creates a dichotomy between the comfort of the individual and the longevity, or mere existance, of the group. Give an example of an extreme case from recent history that favored the group to the detriment of the individual. _How would you embed the principle of balance of the interests of the individual and the group into the ethical code itself?_ Be specific.

#### 3. Present

In the [Study & Discussion](README.md):

1. Write a paragraph answering the question in 2.2.2. Defend your answer by explaining your reasoning.
2. Discuss the topic presented in 2.2.3, and answer the question.
	 
### Section 3: Current ethics examples

#### 1. Study

This brief section is meant to show how diverse and pervasive ethical issues are. In fact, there are - or should be! - ethical considerations just about everything around us.

#### 2. Apply

1. Ethical considerations often arise alongside _inequal circumstances for different participants_ and _conflict among different goals or between goals and means of achieving them_. Read or skim the article [Emerging Code of Ethics for Disaster Relief](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03534-z) and identify the _inequalities_ and _conflicts_ that arise in this domain, and how they complicate ethical behavior.
2. The coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic has opened up a whole tsunami of ethical issues. Pick three (3) ethical issues specifically created by the pandemic and discuss them briefly.

#### 3. Present

In the [Study & Discussion](README.md):

1. Discuss the article in 3.2.1.
2. Discuss the issues you picked in 3.2.2.

### Section 4: Engineering ethics

#### 1. Study

This section contains a sampling of ethics in technical fields, directly or indirectly related to computer engineering. As usual, there is a rich variety of subdomains, niches, and specifics.

#### 2. Apply

1. The Association for Computer Machinery is the premier computer engineering professional society. Read the [ACM's Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics). _How does it mesh with your prior understanding of what computer engineering is about? Did you get a new perspective on an aspect that you hadn't considered up to now?_
2. We live in the era of open source. So much so that even Microsoft has an [Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/). _What does it address? At whom is it targetted? According to it, what is the most important element of ethical behavior when it comes to OSS? What OSS from Microsoft have we been using in our course?_
3. We also live in the age of big data. Data drives everything, from science and medicine, to technology and society. Read this article on [Data Ethics](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsta.2016.0360) from the Royal Society. _What is the main ethical aspect that is hinted at or stated in regards to data?_
4. The International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) is the premier conference on general machine learning in the world, and one of the most prestigious publication venues in the field. It will be held [virtually](https://icml.cc/) this year! Read ICML's [Code of Conduct](https://icml.cc/public/CodeOfConduct). _Why does a technical conference need its very own Code of Conduct? Use the contents to answer the question._
5. Artificial intelligence is the most advanced subfield of machine learning. There have been a lot of fear about how AI may be misused or even how a competitive and/or hostile superintelligence may evolve from our current work in AI. Google, as one of the foremost developers of large-scale AI, felt compelled to publish [Principles of AI Development at Google](https://ai.google/principles/) (also [here](https://ai.google/static/documents/responsible-development-of-ai.pdf)). _What does Google appear to be concerned with? What kind of responsibility are they talking about?_
6. Even though it might at first sound like an _oxymoron_, the term _Ethical Hacking_ is not only a thing, but it is so serious a thing, that it has its own training and certifications. Read about the [Certified Ethical Hacker](https://www.eccouncil.org/ethical-hacking/) provided by the International Council of Electronic Commerce Consultants. _Tease apart the initially inconsistent, as it might appear at first, phrase "ethical hacking". That is, say a bit about "ethics" and "hacking" (as negatively construed), and then discuss how we can attach them together._

#### 3. Present

In the [Study & Discussion](README.md):

1. Include your writing on item 4.2.1.
2. Include your writing on item 4.2.2.
3. Include your writing on item 4.2.3.
4. Include your writing on item 4.2.4.
5. Include your writing on item 4.2.5.
6. Include your writing on item 4.2.6.

### Section 5: Codes of conduct

#### 1. Study

This section dives into the task of designing _ethical codes_. Peruse this [collection](https://drdianehamilton.com/top-10-companies-code-of-ethics-and-conduct-2011/) of some of the Codes of Ethics (aka Codes of Conduct) of some of the most prominent technology companies, study the codes, mark the commonalities, and detect any significant differences.

#### 2. Apply

1. Ethical codes are vulnerable to the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). An ethical code relies on the _cooperation_ of the individuals. Discuss how rogue behavior (aka _defection_) with respect to the ethical code of a group gives rise to the [prinsoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma) and the eventual demise of the ethical code. _What incentives can you build in the ethical code that would counteract the attractiveness of defection and, as a result, would mitigate the danger to the code?_
2. Imagine you are one of the co-founders of a recent computational technology startup.
   1. Come up with the _technical innovation_ at the heart of your reason to exist and your future product or service.
   2. Describe the ways your innovation, if realized, would affect society: 
      1. List at least 3 adverse effects (including but not limited to _misuse_) of the innovation, as well as some of the anticipatory actions and mechanisms you can embed in its deveopment, distribution, and operation to counteract these effects.
      2. Give an _explicit_ definition of the fine line between the benefit and detriment of your innovation at two moments of innovation's lifetime: (a) immediately upon launch; and (b) after enough time has passed that it has been absorbed into everyday life.   
3. Your small group of co-founders and first few key employees are the pivotal _social kernel_ that can define the proper use of your technology. You have to start early, and hold the line. _How are you going to ensure that you stay the course?_ 
4. Define a Code of Ethics (aka Code of Conduct) for your organization, that will safeguard your original intentions and values while not stiflying innovation as your startup grows and matures. Your code should have _at most 9 points_.

#### 3. Present

In the [Study & Discussion](README.md):

1. Include your writing on item 5.2.1.
2. Include your writing on item 5.2.2.
3. Include your writing on item 5.2.3.
4. Include your writing on item 5.2.4.
5. **(CHALLENGE)** Ethical codes are vulnerable to _hostile takeover_ of the adopting organization. Imagine you are one of the acquiring team and you are tasked to sabotage the original team. Remove or modify _3 points_ from The Code, at your discretion, to be the most damaging overall. 
   1. Discuss how and why The Code has been weakened.
   2. Discuss how, in retrospect, the original team should have stated the points of the Code, to forestall sabotage and make it _robust to disruption_. _Note: Beware of the [paradox of self-amendment](https://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/psaessay.htm), which, in short, **"...arises when a rule is used as the authority for its own amendment. It is sharper when the rule of change is supreme, sharper still when it is changed into a form that is inconsistent with its original form, and sharpest of all when the change purports to be irrevocable."**_
